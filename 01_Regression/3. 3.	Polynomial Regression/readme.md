# 📘 Polynomial Regression – Salary vs Experience

This project demonstrates how to build a Polynomial Regression model that predicts an employee's salary based on their years of experience.
The implementation is done in Google Colab, and includes ASCII outputs and user input prediction.

📌 Objective

To predict salary using a Polynomial Regression (degree = 3) model and visualize the relationship between experience and salary.

📂 Dataset

CSV File Path used in Colab:

/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ML(extra)/Regression/salary_experience_dataset.csv

Dataset Format
Experience,Salary
1,45000
2,50000
3,60000
4,65000
...

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

🚀 Features

✔ Load dataset from Google Drive
✔ Display dataset in ASCII format
✔ Polynomial Regression (degree = 3)
✔ Train & evaluate model
✔ User enters experience → ASCII salary prediction
✔ Visualization curve: Salary vs Experience

🧪 Steps Performed

1. Loaded dataset from Google Drive
2. Displayed full dataset in ASCII table
3. Split features (X) and labels (Y)
4. Applied polynomial feature transformation
5. Trained Linear Regression model
6. Displayed model coefficients in ASCII
7. Predicted salary for full dataset
8. Took user input → predicted salary in ASCII
9. Plotted regression curve

▶️ How to Run in Google Colab
1. Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

2. Ensure your CSV file is stored at the path:
/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ML(extra)/Regression/salary_experience_dataset.csv

3. Run the full script:
   
The script will:
Load dataset
Train model
Ask for user input
Print ASCII-based prediction

📈 Output Includes

Full dataset preview in ASCII
Model coefficients
Predicted salaries
User input output in ASCII
Scatter plot + polynomial curve
