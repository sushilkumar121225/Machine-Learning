# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features like **Area (sq.ft), Number of Bedrooms, and Number of Bathrooms**.  
It includes data visualization, training, evaluation, and interactive prediction outputs with attractive formatting.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Load and preprocess a housing dataset  
- Visualize key relationships using scatter plots and heatmaps  
- Train a **Multiple Linear Regression** model  
- Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score  
- Allow users to input custom values for prediction  
- Display prediction results in:
  - Standard formatted output  
  - Banner-style output  
  - ASCII art output using `pyfiglet`
