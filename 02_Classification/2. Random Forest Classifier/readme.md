# ❤️ Random Forest Classifier – Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of heart disease can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.  
This project implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease based on various medical attributes.

The entire practical is implemented in **Google Colab** using Python and demonstrates the complete **machine learning workflow**, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is:
- To build a **machine learning classification model** using the Random Forest algorithm
- To predict the presence of heart disease (`target = 1`) or absence (`target = 0`)
- To evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report
- To visualize important features influencing heart disease prediction
