# 🧩 Hierarchical Clustering – Mall Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering)** to segment mall customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
The objective is to group customers with similar characteristics to help businesses understand customer patterns and improve marketing strategies.

The project is implemented using **Python in Google Colab** and includes complete data preprocessing, dendrogram visualization, cluster formation, and graphical analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
**Dataset Name:** Mall_Customers.csv  

### Attributes:
- CustomerID – Unique customer identifier  
- Gender – Male / Female  
- Age – Customer age  
- Annual Income (k$) – Yearly income  
- Spending Score (1–100) – Customer spending behavior  

For clustering, the following features were used:
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1–100)**

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- SciPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyFiglet (for ASCII output)

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Selected relevant features for clustering  
3. Constructed a **Dendrogram** using Ward’s linkage method  
4. Determined optimal number of clusters  
5. Applied **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**  
6. Visualized customer segments using scatter plots  

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Dendrogram for cluster selection  
- Scatter plot showing customer clusters based on income and spending score  

---

## ✅ Results
- Customers were successfully grouped into **5 distinct clusters**
- Each cluster represents a unique customer segment with similar spending behavior
- The results can be used for targeted marketing and customer analysis

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload `Mall_Customers.csv`
3. Run the provided Python notebook cells sequentially
4. Observe dendrogram and clustering visualizations

## 🎯 Applications
- Customer Segmentation
- Targeted Marketing
- Business Decision Making
- Retail Analytics
