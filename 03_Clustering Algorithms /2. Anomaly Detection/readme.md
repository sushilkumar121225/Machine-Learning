# 🚨 DBSCAN Clustering – Fraud & Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates how DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) can be used to detect fraudulent or anomalous transaction patterns in an unsupervised machine learning setting.

The practical is fully implemented in Python using Google Colab, with clear visualizations and ASCII banner outputs for better understanding.

📌 Project Overview

Fraud detection is a critical task in banking and financial systems. Traditional supervised models require labeled data, which is often unavailable.
DBSCAN solves this problem by identifying outliers (noise points) that do not belong to any dense cluster — treated as fraudulent transactions.

🎯 Objectives

Implement DBSCAN clustering for anomaly detection

Identify fraudulent transactions as outliers

Visualize normal vs fraudulent behavior

Understand density-based clustering concepts

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

PyFiglet (for ASCII banners)

📊 Dataset Description

Synthetic transaction dataset

Features:

Transaction_Amount

Transaction_Frequency

Normal transactions form dense clusters

Fraudulent transactions are randomly scattered (anomalies)

🧠 Algorithm Used
🔹 DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

Groups points based on density

No need to specify number of clusters

Identifies:

Core points

Border points

Noise points (Frauds)

Cluster Label Interpretation:

-1 → Fraud / Anomaly

0, 1, ... → Normal transaction clusters

📈 Visualizations Included

Raw transaction data scatter plot

Clustered data visualization

Highlighted fraud/anomaly points

Clear color distinction between normal & fraud transactions

🧪 Steps Performed

Installed required libraries

Generated synthetic transaction data

Visualized raw dataset

Applied feature scaling

Implemented DBSCAN clustering

Detected fraud/anomalies

Visualized clustering results

Displayed fraud transaction records

🔮 Future Enhancements

Use real-world credit card fraud datasets

Optimize eps and min_samples parameters

Compare DBSCAN with Isolation Forest & LOF

Deploy as a fraud detection web application
