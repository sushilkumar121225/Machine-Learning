# Association Rule Mining using Apriori Algorithm

## Objective
To analyze customer purchasing behavior using Market Basket Analysis
and extract association rules using the Apriori algorithm.

## Dataset
- market_basket.csv
- Contains transactional purchase data
- Each row represents items purchased together

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- mlxtend

## Steps Performed
1. Created market basket dataset
2. Converted transactions into encoded format
3. Applied Apriori algorithm
4. Generated frequent itemsets
5. Extracted association rules
6. Visualized support and lift values

## Key Concepts
- Support
- Confidence
- Lift
- Frequent Itemsets
- Association Rules

## Result
The Apriori algorithm successfully identified meaningful relationships
between items frequently purchased together.

## Conclusion
Association Rule Mining helps businesses understand customer buying
patterns and optimize product placement and promotions.
